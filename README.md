# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using MultiOutputRegressor - RandomForestRegressor

This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor`. It was developed as part of the one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by **Shell** in **June 2025**.
